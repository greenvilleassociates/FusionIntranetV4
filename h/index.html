<H3> SSO & SEARCH ENGINE INSTALLER HOME PAGE </H3>
<span>Joomla is installed in this directory already... if PHP indexing is enabled and put in first position... you'll get index.php first.</span><BR>
<span>However your nginx.conf, Apache vhost, or IISWeb.config must be set to load index.php before index.html or index.htm which is not standard</span><BR>
<span>This site requires PHP 7.4 or PHP 8.06 to run Joomla 3.10 which is included with this distribution.</span><BR>
<span> You DO NOT WANT TO UPGRADE JOOMLA to 4.0 or 5.0 with this product as it removes native APIs which are required for advanced PLL(Page Level Locking)</span><BR>
